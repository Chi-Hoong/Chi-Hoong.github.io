			<h1>Where the money would come from?</h1>
			
			<p>Implementing these policies to reduce construction noise will cost money. For example, erection of noise barriers around MRT and HDB construction sites would increase the cost of the construction.</p>
			<p>Different noise control policies will have different costs.</p>
			<p>In order to fund the noise control policy the government will have to raise funds through additional charges.</p>
			<p>Keep in mind that these additional charges will reduce the amount of money you will need to pay to reduce the impact of construction noise in your home. For example, you may not need to use air-conditioning if construction activities are disallowed on weekends.</p>
