			<h1>Section 2: Valuing a Reduction in Construction Noise</h1>
			
			<p>In this section of the survey, we will like to find out how much 
			you are willing to pay for a reduction in construction noise. You 
			will be presented with 8 scenarios. In each scenario, there will be 
			a background noise, which is the current level of noise. When you 
			mouse-over the alternatives, you will hear a different noise as well 
			as an increase in the service and conservancy charges (S&amp;CC). In the 
			first four scenarios, the construction noise occurs in the day, while 
			in the next four scenarios, the construction noise occurs in the 
			night. </p>
			<p>Please choose the option you prefer most, taking into account the 
			changes in noise level as well as the change in S&amp;CC. When answering 
			each scenario, only use the information provided in the that 
			scenario, without referencing previous scenarios. </p>
			<p>When answering the questions, please consider the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The option that receives the greatest amount of support will 
				be implemented and all residents will make the payment required 
				for that option;</li>
				<li>Each construction site is expected to last for a period of 
				3-years (36 months), so you will have to pay the monthly charges 
				associated with the option you choose for this period; and</li>
				<li>Your income is limited and you have other expenses.</li>
			</ul>
