			<h1>Construction Noise in Singapore</h1>
			
			<p>In the remainder of this section, you will be presented with 8 
			scenarios, each of which comprises of:
			<ul>
				<li>A background noise. This is the current level of noise 
				and will be the noise level that you experience if no noise 
				reduction measures are taken.</li>
				<li>Two options with different noises and a monthly fee that you 
				will have to pay in order to enjoy the reduction in noise associated
				with that option. Mouse-over the alternatives to
				hear the different types of noise.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the first four scenarios, the construction noise occurs in the 
			day (between 7am and 5pm), while in the next four scenarios, the construction noise occurs 
			in the night (between 5pm and 7am). </p>
