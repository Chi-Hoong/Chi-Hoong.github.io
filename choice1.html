			<h1>Your Choices</h1>
			
			<p>We want to find out how much you are willing to pay for a 
			reduction in construction noise. You will be presented with 8 
			scenarios, each of which comprises of:
			<ul>
				<li>A background noise. This is the current level of noise 
				and will be the noise level that you experience if no noise 
				reduction measures are taken.</li>
				<li>Two options with different noises and an increase in service
				and conservancy charges (S&amp;CC). Mouse-over the alternatives to
				hear the different types of noise.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In the first four scenarios, the construction noise occurs in the 
			day, while in the next four scenarios, the construction noise occurs 
			in the night. </p>
			
			<p>Please choose the option you prefer most, taking into account the 
			changes in noise level as well as the change in S&amp;CC. When answering 
			each scenario, only use the information provided in the that 
			scenario, without referencing previous scenarios. </p>
			<p>When answering the questions, please consider the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The option that receives the greatest amount of support will 
				be implemented and all residents will make the payment required 
				for that option;</li>
				<li>Each construction site is expected to last for a period of 
				3-years (36 months), so you will have to pay the monthly charges 
				associated with the option you choose for this period; and</li>
				<li>Your income is limited and you have other expenses.</li>
			</ul>
