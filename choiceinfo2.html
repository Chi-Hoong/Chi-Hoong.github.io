			<h1>What can be done?</h1>
			
			<p>Construction noise could be reduced if some of the following measures
			were adopted:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Change the equipment used for construction, so that quieter
				construction equipment is used.</li>
				<li>Erect noise barriers between the construction site and 
				residences near the site.</li>
				<li>Plan construction activities so that noisier construction
				work is carried out when residents are away from home.</li>
				<li>Have larger buffer distances between construction sites and
				residences so that the noise can dissipate before it reaches residences.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>How much noise levels can be reduced depend on how many of these measures
			are adopted and how they are combined.</p>
