			<h1>How will the results of the survey be used?</h1>
			
			<p>The results of the survey will inform policies related to the 
			control of construction noise. The project is funded by the Ministry 
			of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore, and is undertaken 
			with the assistance of the Crawford School of Public Policy from the 
			Australian National University. <br></p>
			<p>While the information gained from this survey may be revealed in 
			research publications and reports, all participants will remain 
			anonymous, unless they explicitly indicate that they are willing to 
			be identified when quoted. Any information provided in answering the 
			questionnaire that might identify anyone as individuals will be 
			held in complete confidence. All information collected during this 
			research will be stored electronically (no names attached) for at 
			least 5 years after the publication of results.</p>
