			<h2>General Outline of the Project</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Description and methodology</em>: <span>Estimate the willingness-to-pay for a reduction in construction noise among residents in Singapore with a choice modelling survey.</span></li>
				<li><em>Participants</em>: <span>We will be surveying 600 individuals through a laboratory-based survey from a panel of a survey company.</span></li>
				<li><em>Use of data and feedback</em>: <span>The results of the survey will be published on ANU’s website. If you would like to receive updates on the outcomes of the research, you could leave your email with us at the end of the survey.</span> </li>
				<li><em>Project funding</em>: <span>This survey is funded by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore.</span></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Participant Involvement</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Voluntary participation and withdrawal</em>: <span>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may decline to take part or to withdraw from the research without providing an explanation at any time until you have submitted the survey. As this survey is designed to be confidential you would not be able to withdraw your response upon submission of the completed survey questionnaire.</span></li>
				<li><em>What does participation in this survey entail?</em>: <span>You are invited to take part in a survey to ascertain the willingness-to-pay for a reduction in construction noise. The survey questionnaire consists of three main sections: (i) a series of questions where you choose between different types of construction noises and costs; (ii) a hearing acuity test to understand your sensitivity to sounds; and (iii) a demography section to understand your background.</span></li>
				<li><em>Location and duration</em>: <span>The survey will be conducted in a laboratory at <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to be confirmed</span>. The survey will consist of a single questionnaire which will require approximately 30 minutes to complete.</span></li>
				<li><em>Remuneration</em>: <span>We will be providing an incentive of $10 worth of NTUC vouchers for participation in this survey to compensate for your time to take part in this survey.</span></li>
				<li><em>Risks</em>: <span>You will have full control over whether you will like to proceed with the survey and you can terminate the survey at any point. If, for any reason, you will like to exit or stop participation, an exit button is provided for you to stop participation immediately.</span></li>
				<li><em>Benefits</em>: <span>This project will provide us with an estimate of the benefits associated with an abatement of construction noise in Singapore, which would, in turn, enable us to propose policies to regulate construction noise.</span></li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><em>Participant limitation</em>: <span>You can only participate in this survey if you are a resident in Singapore and aged 18 or over.</span> </li>
