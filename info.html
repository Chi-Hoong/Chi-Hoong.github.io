			<h2>General Outline of the Project</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Description and methodology</em>: <span>Estimate the 
				willingness-to-pay for a reduction in construction noise among 
				residents in Singapore with a choice modelling survey.</span></li>
				<li><em>Participants</em>: <span>We will be surveying 600 
				individuals through a laboratory-based survey from a panel of a 
				survey company.</span></li>
				<li><em>Use of data and feedback</em>: <span>The results of the 
				survey will be published on ANU’s website and if you would like 
				to receive updates on the outcomes of the research, you could 
				leave your email with us at the end of the survey.</span> </li>
				<li><em>Project funding</em>: <span>This survey is funded by the 
				Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore.</span></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Participant Involvement</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Voluntary participation and withdrawal</em>: <span>Your 
				participation in this research is voluntary, and you may decline 
				to take part or to withdraw from the research without providing 
				an explanation at any time until you have submitted the survey. 
				As this survey is designed to be confidential you would not be 
				able to withdraw your response, upon submission of the completed 
				survey questionnaire.</span></li>
				<li><em>What does participation in this survey entail?</em>:
				<span>You are invited to take part in a survey to ascertain the 
				willingness-to-pay for a reduction in construction noise. You 
				are invited to take part in a survey to ascertain the 
				willingness-to-pay for a reduction in construction noise. The 
				survey questionnaire consists of three main sections, (i) a 
				hearing acuity test to understand your sensitivity to sounds; 
				(ii) a series of questions where you choose between different 
				types of construction noises and costs; and (iii) a demography 
				section to understand your background.</span></li>
				<li><em>Location and duration</em>: <span>The survey will be 
				conducted in a laboratory at
				<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to be confirmed</span>. 
				The survey will consist of a single questionnaire which will 
				require approximately 30 minutes to complete.</span></li>
				<li><em>Remuneration</em>: <span>We will be providing an 
				incentive of $10 worth of NTUC vouchers for participation in 
				this survey to compensate for your time and travel costs to take 
				this survey.</span></li>
				<li><em>Risks</em>: <span>The research carries little risk, 
				although you may feel uncomfortable when we are playing recorded 
				construction noises to you, particularly if your hearing is 
				sensitive or you have an existing hearing impairment. If you 
				experience any discomfort during the survey, you can terminate 
				the survey at any time. We would also appreciate your feedback 
				should you experience any discomfort if you wish to inform us.</span></li>
				<li><em>Benefits</em>: <span>In 2015, the National Environment 
				Agency received more than 16,000 complaints related to 
				construction noise, partly as a result of the high number of 
				construction sites in Singapore. This project will provide us 
				with an estimate of the benefits associated with an abatement of 
				construction noise in Singapore, which would, in turn, enable us 
				to propose policies to regulate construction noise. A reduction 
				in noise levels will improve Singapore’s livability.</span></li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Exclusion Criteria</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Participant limitation</em>: <span>You can only 
				participate in this survey if you are a resident in Singapore 
				and aged 18 or over.</span> </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Confidentiality</em>: <span>We will keep your identity 
				confidential as far as allowed by law, unless you elect to be 
				named within the research. Access to the data you provide will 
				be restricted to the research team, and identifying details will 
				be stored separately from the rest of the research data. 
				Published results will only be reported in aggregate, and you 
				will not be identifiable within published outputs unless you 
				have elected otherwise.</span></li>
			</ul>
