			<h1>Participant Information Sheet</h1>
			
			<h2>General Outline of the Project</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Description and methodology</em>: The goal of this research project is to estimate the willingness-to-pay for a reduction in construction noise among residents. In this survey we will like to seek your views on whether you will be willing to pay for a reduction in construction noise. Over the course of this survey, we will be playing a series of recorded noise back to you and you will pick your most preferred option given the information provided in each option.</li>
				<li><em>Participants</em>: We will be surveying 600 individuals through a laboratory-based survey. Each respondent will be presented with a similar survey form. Since we will like to standardise the noises presented to each respondent, all surveys will be conducted at a venue to be decided by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore.</li>
				<li><em>Use of data and feedback</em>: The results of the survey will be published on ANU’s website and if you would like to receive updates on the outcomes of the research, you could leave your email with us at the end of the survey. </li>
				<li><em>Project funding</em>: This survey is funded by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Participant Involvement</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Voluntary participation and withdrawal</em>: Your participation in this survey is entirely voluntary and you may, without negative consequences, decline to take part or withdraw from this survey without providing an explanation. You can also choose to refuse to answer any specific question in the survey. If you choose to withdraw, we will destroy any data that you have already provided, unless you indicate that you would wish to allow us to use the data you have provided.</li>
				<li><em>What does participation in this survey entail?</em>: In order to participate in this survey, we will like to request that you complete this survey questionnaire. The survey questionnaire is broadly divided into three main sections. First, we will be asking a series of questions to understand how well you hear. We will also be playing a series of recorded sounds at various frequencies and you will indicate which is the quietest level of noise you can perceive the sound. Next, we will present a series of questions, each containing several options on different types of construction noise for you to indicate your preference. Finally, we will ask several demographic questions to understand your background.</li>
				<li><em>Location and duration</em>: The survey will conducted in a laboratory at a venue to be decided by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources. The survey will consist of a single questionnaire which will require approximately 30 minutes to complete.</li>
				<li><em>Remuneration</em>: We will be providing an incentive of $10 worth of NTUC vouchers for participation in this survey to compensate for your time and travel costs to take this survey.</li>
				<li><em>Risks</em>: As part of the survey, we will be playing recorded construction noise to you. We have made efforts to ensure that these recorded noises are within acceptable ranges. Specifically, they adhere to the Singapore’s National Environment Agency’s guidelines on the loudness of construction noise. However, due to the nature of construction noise, you may feel slight discomfort from hearing the noise, particularly if your hearing is sensitive. If you experience any discomfort, please feel free to terminate the survey at any time. We would also appreciate your feedback should you experience any discomfort if you wish to inform us.</li>
				<li><em>Benefits</em>: Singapore is a noisy city. In 2015, the National Environment Agency received more than 16,000 complaints related to construction noise, partly as a result of the high number of construction sites in Singapore. This project will provide us with an estimate of the benefits associated with an abatement of construction noise in Singapore, which would in turn enable us to propose policies to regulate construction noise. A reduction in noise levels will improve Singapore’s liveability.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Exclusion Criteria</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Participant limitation</em>: You can only participate in this survey if you are a resident in Singapore and aged 18 or over. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Confidentiality</em>: Confidentiality of the data you provide us over the course of this survey will be protected as far as the law allows. We have also designed the questionnaire so that you will not have to provide us with any information that you could identify you if you choose not to. The raw data will only be used by the nominated researchers. When publishing results, we will only reveal aggregated information so that responses cannot be attributed to any one individual.</li>
				<li><em>Privacy notice</em>: In collecting your personal information within this research, the ANU must comply with the Privacy Act 1988. The ANU Privacy Policy is available at <span><a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_010007">https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_010007</a></span> and it contains information about how a person can: (i) Access or seek correction to their personal information; and (ii) Complain about a breach of an Australian Privacy Principle by ANU, and how ANU will handle the complaint.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data Storage</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Where</em>: During collection of the data, the data will be stored securely on the servers of the survey company. The data will be deleted immediately after the finalised dataset is transferred to the researchers. We will store the data securely on the computers at the ANU for data analysis and preparation of the final reports. The computer storing the data will be password-protected and the data will be encrypted. Data storage will be stored in accordance with the ANU Responsible Practice of Research Policies.</li>
				<li><em>Duration</em>: The data will be stored for a period of five years after publication. The data will be stored electronically in Word and Excel format, with no personal identifiers attached. The original data will be retained securely in the department, in accordance with the data storage procedures of the ANU and the Crawford School of Public Policy.</li>
				<li><em>Handling of data following the required storage period</em>: After the five-year storage period, the data will be archived by the researchers securely in Word and Excel format, with no personal identifiers attached. The storage will be in accordance with the data storage procedures of the ANU and the Crawford School of Public Policy.</li>
