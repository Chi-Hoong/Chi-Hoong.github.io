			<h1>Section 2: Construction Noise in Singapore</h1>
			
			<p>Singapore is geographically small, highly urbanised and densely populated. The rapid pace of development has led to a high number of construction sites in Singapore. </p>
			
			<p>Construction activity is required to build Singapore's infrastructure, such as our transportation network, new residences as well as factories and offices. However, the construction activities also causes harms for residents near the construction site. In particular, residents living near construction sites may experience higher levels of noise.</p>
			
			<p>In this section of the survey, we will like to find out how much you are willing to pay for a reduction in construction noise.</p>
			
			<p>Your responses to this section are important. Survey results will inform policies that the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources can implement to control construction noise.</p>
